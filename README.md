<img src="claykind.png" alt="claykind" align="right"/>

A tiny library to produce [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly/) expressions from Clojure source code.
This library is intended for use by literate programming tools such as [Clay](https://github.com/scicloj/clay) which produce documents from code.

```
Code -> Kindly-spec (what to display)
```

```clojure
[{:kind :kind/table
  :value {:column-names ... :row-maps}}
 {:kind :kind/vega-lite
  :value {...}}]
```

```dot
digraph G {
  Code -> Kindly
  Kindly -> Clay
  Kindly -> Portal
  Portal -> Calva
  Portal -> Cursive
  Portal -> Browser
  Kindly -> Markdown
  Markdown -> Quarto
  Markdown -> Pandoc
  Quarto -> HTML
  Quarto -> PDF
  Quarto -> RevealJS
  Pandoc -> HTML
  Pandoc -> PDF
}
```

## Rationale

A glue library can be made use of in more contexts.
The Kindly specs can be used for the creation of markdown, tests, or other purposes.

## Status
